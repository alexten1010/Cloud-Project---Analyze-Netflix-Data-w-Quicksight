# Cloud-Project---Analyze-Netflix-Data-w-Quicksight

This project was created using my AWS account.

The project showcases how a cloud-scale business intelligence service allows organizations to easily create, publish, and share business analytics dashboards and reports.
Its a fully managed cloud-based service with no infrastructure to deploy or manage.
Quicksight also provides enterprise-grade security, global availability, and built-in redundancy.
